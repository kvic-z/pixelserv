[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kvic-z/pixelserv-tls.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kvic-z/pixelserv-tls)


_pixelserv-tls_ is a tiny bespoke HTTP/1.1 webserver with HTTPS and SNI support. It acts on behalf of hundreds of thousands of advert/tracker servers and responds to all requests with  nothing  to  speed  up  web browsing.

_pixelserv-tls_  supports TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.2 and thus could operate with a wide range of browsers and client devices.  Server  certificates  for any  given  advert/tracker domains are generated automatically on first use and saved to disk.

pixelserv-tls can log access and HTTP/1.1 POST contents to syslog. So it  is  also  a  useful  tool  to  inspect and expose 'wrongly blocked' domains as well as 'rogue' domains invading user privacy.
